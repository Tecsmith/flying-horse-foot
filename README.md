# The Flying Horse Foot

This body of work is our attempt to build a clone of "The Pegasus Hoof" keyboard controller.

This came about because some time ago I'd bought a Filco MJ2 TLK mechanical keyboard with the intent to use it as a basis of a custom build Mechanical Board ... alas, other things had priority and 7 years later I found that I could no longer buy the hacker controller - "The Pegasus Hoof" - by Fredrik Atmer of ["Bathroom Epiphanies Inc."](http://bathroomepiphanies.com/controllers/)
